<i> ggpaintr</i> is a R package that allows you to visualize your data with an online shiny app.

From the left navigation panel you'll be able to upload your data and choose what type of plot you want to draw as well as changing the mapping and color/fill variables.

This application is driven by [shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) and you may find the code on [github](https://github.com/willju-wangqian/ggpaintr/).
